Gives a copyable string to put into the Pokemon Go search box for raiding.

Hello everyone,
I recently started playing POGO again and fell in love with the search function. 
I searched for apps and services, that take proper advantage of it, but couldn't find any.
So I'm introducing PokeString BETA. 
A tiny Web App, that helps with choosing the right Pokemon for Raids. 
It let's you filter your Pokemon through the search function, to only show you effective ones on the fly.

How it works (TL;DR)?
1. Choose the type/s of the defending Pokemon
2. Choose how many attacks of your Pokemon should be effective (None will allow all attacks)
3. Choose what kind of types your Pokemon should have relative to the attackers type (None will allow all types)
4. Press 'Go'
5. Press 'Copy to Clipboard'
6. Paste into your POGO search bar
7. Enjoy your filtered PKMN!

I have no idea, why this isn't a thing, but I got quite the good use out of it already. 
Maybe this exists and I just didn't find it... Either way, I made this and everyone who likes it, is free to use it as well.
A bit about the technicals/current status?
Since it's a website, it works on Android and iOS. 
I added a couple languages (since the search works in your games language), 
but I haven't tested it for most of these and there might be typos in all of them, or other kinds of bugs. 
Feel free to test it to your hearts contents and write me if you find anything. 
Since I couldn't find a list of supported languages for the game, 
I just added a bunch of European ones, translated the types if there is a translation in that language and asked friends for translation of other parts. 

Why the strange url?
I don't expect this to get much traction, so this is an app for me mostly. 
I don't care about the url and this way, I can host it completely free. 
Should this get popular, I might get a domain and even add more functionality. 
We will have to see about that, when it's time. (There is a cookie-free hidden visitor counter, which I will check from time to time)

There are no cookies. Does that mean, I will have to change my language every time I open the app?
No. It's correct, that there aren't any cookies (yay no cookie pop-ups), but there is an easy way, 
to always open the app in your preferred language. Just add a "?<lang>" at the end of the url. 
So for English, the URL would be: https://complicative.github.io?en. 
Save it as a bookmark, or even put it on your homescreen and it should work flawlessly.
  
The supported languages with their lang codes are:
English: en
French: fr
Finnish: fi
German: de
Italian: it
Norwegian: no
Spanish: es
Swedish: sv
Klingon: kli (don't ask)
